=============
ChainConsumer
=============

ChainConsumer is a python package designed to do one thing - consume the chains
output from Monte Carlo processes like MCMC. ChainConsumer can utilise these chains
to produce plots of the posterior surface inferred from the chain distributions,
to plot the chains as walks (to check for mixing and convergence), and to output
parameter summaries in the form of LaTeX tables.

To get things started, here is a basic example:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from chainconsumer import ChainConsumer

    mean = [0.0, 4.0]
    data = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, [[1.0, 0.7], [0.7, 1.5]], size=100000)

    c = ChainConsumer()
    c.add_chain(data, parameters=["$x_1$", "$x_2$"])
    c.plot(filename="example.png", figsize="column", truth=mean)


The output figure is displayed below.

.. figure::     ../paper/example.png
   :align:     center
   :width:     80%
